# benui.ca Feedback & Bug Reporting

People have been messaging me with bugs and mistakes on benu.ca, which is awesome!
But I often don't have time to fix it right away, and by the time I do, I've forgotten where the feedback was.

So I'm going to use the Issue section of this repo to list the bugs and when I fix them update the issue.

If you have any feedback, feel free to send it via Twitter or Discord, but also feel free to make Issues yourself.
